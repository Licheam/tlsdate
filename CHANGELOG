0.0.2 XXX
  Add '-n' and '--dont-set-clock' option to fetch but not set time
  Add '-V' and '--showtime' option to display remote time
  Add '-t' and '--timewarp' option
    If the local clock is before RECENT_COMPILE_DATE; we set the clock to the
    RECENT_COMPILE_DATE. If the local clock is after RECENT_COMPILE_DATE, we
    leave the clock alone. Clock setting is performed as the first operation
    and will impact certificate verification. Specifically, this option is
    helpful if on first boot, the local system clock is set back to the era
    of Disco and Terrible Hair. This should ensure that 
    X509_V_ERR_CERT_NOT_YET_VALID or X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED are not
    encountered because of a broken RTC or the lack of a local RTC; we assume
    that tlsdate is recompiled yearly and that all certificates are otherwise
    considered valid.
  Add '-l' and '--leap'
    Normally, the passing of time or time yet to come ensures that SSL verify
    functions will fail to validate certificates. Commonly,
    X509_V_ERR_CERT_NOT_YET_VALID and X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED are painfully
    annoying but still very important error states. When the only issue with
    the certificates in question is the timing information, this option allows
    one to trust the remote system's time, as long as it is after
    RECENT_COMPILE_DATE and before MAX_REASONABLE_TIME. The connection will
    only be trusted if X509_V_ERR_CERT_NOT_YET_VALID and/or
    X509_V_OKX509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED are the only errors encountered. The
    SSL verify function will not return X509_V_OK if there are any other
    issues, such as self-signed certificates or if the user pins to a CA that
    is not used by the remote server. This is useful if your RTC is broken on
    boot and you are unable to use DNSSEC until you've at least had some kind
    of leap of cryptographically assured data.
